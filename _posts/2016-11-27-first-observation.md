### Plain vs. Fancy 

|	   |Tweets |Following    |Followers   |Likes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Plain |3,637 |1,078 |154 |6,805 |
|Fancy |3,739 |3,578 |630 |8,377 |

While the Fancy and Plain bots have the same level of tweet activity, the Fancy bot has four times the number of followers. The Fancy bot is following 3 times the plain bot, so I will need to check the bot settings.

So far it appears that people are more likely to follow twitter accounts. However the greater number of followers may be impacting the results.
