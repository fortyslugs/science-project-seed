09 Dec 2016    data-observation

Plain vs. Fancy
The differences between the plain and fancy bots are not as pronounced as the differences between the chatty and quiet bots.
While the plain bot has more tweets and more likes than the fancy bot, it has significantly fewer "following" and "followers".

|	   |Tweets |Following     |Followers    |Likes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Plain |4,552 |	1,428 |205 |	8,542|
|Fancy |3,728 |	3,565 |	634| 	8,363|
