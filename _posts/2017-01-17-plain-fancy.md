### Plain vs. Fancy


17 JAN 2017    data-observation

Plain vs. Fancy
The differences between the plain and fancy bots are not as pronounced as the differences between the chatty and quiet bots.
While the plain bot has more tweets and more likes than the fancy bot, it has significantly fewer "following" and "followers". 
It is possible that the "Fancy" bot has fewer Tweets due to a former "crash". The "Fancy" bot may still be lagging behind the 
"Plain" bot as a result of the earlier crash. 

|	   |Tweets |Following     |Followers    |Likes |

|Plain |7,533 |	2,479 |354 |	14,300|
|Fancy |6,302 |5,005 |	920| 	14,000|
