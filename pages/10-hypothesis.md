## Overview

On social media content and engagement matters. If you actively engage with other members on a social media platform and deliver better content, you will be able to attract more followers and thus have more influence.

For my project I set-up as series of experiments using Twitter. 

### Experiment #1 - Compare follower growth with account profile design:
1. Account with plain profile
2. Account with enhanced profile

Hypothesis: The account with an enhanced social profile should receive significantly more followers over time.

### Experiment #2 - Compare follower growth with social engagement:
1. Account with active tweeting activity and social engagement
2. Account with low activities and no social engagement

Hypothesis: Accounts with active users should receive significantly more followers over time.
