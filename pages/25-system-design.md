### Design of Experiment

1. Design objectives of the system
    * Use a Bot that can be configured to isolation one parameter for the set of experiments
    * Create a unique set of Twitter accounts which will be controled by the bot

2. Operating requirements
    * Bots will run autonomously
    * The bot will log the number of followers, tweets, and likes

### Configuration of the Bot
1. Hours of operation, frequency of communication
    * Each bot operates from 8am to 9pm, 7 days a week
    * The frequency of the bot communication is defined for each experiment
    
2. Content of bot communication
   * All bots use the same "keywords" which are used to search for tweets
   * The keywords were all related Disneyland, Disney movies and vides, and actors that performed in Disney productions
   
3. Method of communication
   * The bots searches for tweets that match the keyword list
   * For each tweet that matched the keywords, the bots retweeted the tweet, liked the tweet, and followed the author of the tweet

### Configuration of the Twitter accounts
1. Twitter profile configuration
   * The profile is configured according to the experiment
   * The configuration includes the account profile picture, the backgroud, the location
