After the each Twitter account and Bot has been configured according to the experiment design, I monitored each account's results

Step:
  1. Log into each of the four Twitter account, and reviewed the number of tweets, the following count, follower count, and likes
  2. For the two experiments, I made an observation of the results
  3. When necessary, I fixed the Twitter or Bot configuration if I found any issues
